# Stock-price-using-nse-and-bse

-> First of all I strated the django project and created a template with index.html with input tag.

-> Created a function named "api" that takes data from two different rest api of nse and bse and then merge with one common column of symbol name.

-> Pushed the merged data into database (sqlite default database) and search index of entered symbol name.

-> Passed all the data into HTML file and print in a table and IF we did not found then its gave one parameter.
